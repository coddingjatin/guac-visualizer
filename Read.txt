GUAC Visualizer
The GUAC Visualizer is an experimental utility that can be used to interact with the GUAC services. It acts as a way to visualize the software supply chain graph as well as a means to explore the supply chain, and prototype policies.

Since the GUAC Visualizer is still in an early experimental stage, it is likely that there may be some unexpected behavior or usage problems. For a more robust use of GUAC, we recommend using the GraphQL interface directly.
